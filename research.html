	<h2>Research Overview</h2>
  <p> My advisor is Stephen Bigelow. My research interests are broadly in quantum algebra, operator algebras, and low-dimensional topology. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>My thesis is on subfactor planar algebras, which is a subject with connections to
  a vast variety of mathematics including tensor categories, knot theory, subfactors, mathematical physics, and representation theory. </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Planar algebras are families of vector spaces together with multi-linear maps that can be encoded by diagrams in the plane. A special type of these planar algebras are called
    subfactor planar algebras, which were introduced by Vaughan Jones as an axiomatization of the standard invariant of a subfactor. These planar algebras also encode two other
invariants of the subfactors: the index and the principal graph. The Kuperberg Program asks to find diagrammatic presentations of all subfactor planar algebras. This program has been completed for index less
than 4. For my thesis, I am specifically focusing on completing The Kuperberg Program for index 4. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p> </p>
	<p> I was also a graduate mentor for a summer 2022 REU project at the intersection of knot theory
    and graph theory. There is a pairing between some knots and graphs such that certain knot polynomials
    can be recovered from a corresponding graph polynomial. Our REU group obtained the Jones polynomial
    for a family of links arising from the closure of a braid of a particular form using a graph polynomial arising
    from their balanced overlaid Tait graphs. My mentees typed their results in a poster, which you can view
      <a href="REU-poster.pdf">here</a>. This project was led by <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/sanjaylkumar/home?authuser=0">Sanjay Kumar</a>, and is also joint with <a href="https://www.math.uci.edu/node/37889">Derya Asaner</a>, Andrew Pease, and
      <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/anup-poudel/home">Anup Poudel</a>.

  <p>I love discussing my research, so if you would like any more details on any of my projects, please feel free to email me.</p>

  <!--<h3>Project 1: Give diagrammatic presentations by generators and relations for subfactor planar algebras of index 4.</h3>
  <p> Synopsis: The category of representations of a finite group is an example of a fusion category. Within this type of category we can take linear combinations of morphisms, and tensor products and direct sums of objects. A planar algebra can be constructed from a unitary fusion category with the advantage that the structure is now conveniently encoded by diagrams in the plane. Conversely, given a <em>subfactor</em> planar algebra, we can construct a fusion category of projections. The Kuperberg program is a proposal to give a presentation by generators and relations for every subfactor planar algebra. For my eventual thesis I hope to give diagrammatic presentations for the subfactor planar algebras of index 4. I have currently finished the \(\tilde{A}_{2n-1}\) and \(\tilde{D}_\infty\) cases and am in the process of writing this paper. For more details on the project you can click <a href="bridgesposterfinal.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

  <h3>Project 2: Recovering knot polynomials from graphs.</h3>
  <p> Synopsis: The goal of this project is to obtain knot polynomials from the use of graph theory. This project is through the UCSB REU program where I serve as a graduate mentor. You can read a full description of the project <a href="Kumar-Molander-REU.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>!-->
