    I am a co-organizer of the upcoming AMS Special Session on
    "Advances in Quantum Topology, Tensor Categories, and Diagrammatic Algebras"
    at the AMS 2025 Fall Eastern Virtual Sectional.
    The full program will be posted

      <p>
        I am beginning a postdoc at The Ohio State University, working on subfactors, planar algebras, and tensor categories.
        I have been a member of OAMN since 2023, and the network has been incredibly helpful to me in providing both support
        and opportunities for connection within the operator algebras community. I am excited at the prospect to serve on the
        board to help advance the mission of this outstanding program. Having founded and led UC Santa Barbara's Association
        for Women in Mathematics chapter, I bring leadership experience and a commitment to community-building that I hope to
        contribute in support of the network’s future.
